								<p>Dear Reader, <br>

									As someone who was born and raised in Hawaii, the topic of Native Hawaiian rights has always been in the local media. We are taught about Hawaiian history in school from a young age and the injustice they have faced. I believe that this gives us a unique perspective in looking at an event such as the TMT construction. In light of this controversy, the topic was put into the national spotlight where native culture and science were put against each other. <br><br>
This is not the first time something like this has happened in history; this page is dedicated to looking at all points of view and how it compares to those events in the past. We will look at Neocolonialism and how it relates to this topic along with some Q&As with some of my close friends who are a part of the Native Hawaiian community. We will also look at bias in general and how this event has been portrayed in the media.
<br><br>

I would like to make clear that I am personally not a Native Hawaiian. I cannot speak on behalf of those who have felt these injustices. Though this page is dedicated to putting out facts, I canâ€™t guarantee that there will be no personal bias. As someone who is proudly from Hawaii, we have been taught to preserve the Hawaiian culture regardless of our ethnic background. Hopefully, given all the information on this website, you can make your own judgement on the controversy.<br><br> Click one of the links below to get started.

Thank you,<br>
Ashlyn<br>
