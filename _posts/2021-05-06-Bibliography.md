Central Material


Swanner, Leandra. “Instruments of Science or Conquest? Neocolonialism and Modern American Astronomy.” Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences 47, no. 3 (June 1, 2017): 293–319. https://doi.org/10.1525/hsns.2017.47.3.293.

	This paper by Leandra Swanner gives a great background on the controversy behind the construction of the telescope on Mauna Kea. She talks about how modern American astronomy has changed over the years moving into the public eye and also argues that “the TMT debate can best be understood as an exemplar of what [she] refer(s) to as ‘neocolonialist science’. (296)” She goes deeply into how Western science needs to come to terms with the role it has on Native peoples, nature and technology. This is great for this project as it gives base knowledge of the (Native) Hawaiian culture needed for this topic along with background information on the astronomy “culture”.


Aanchal, Saraf. “‘We’d Rather Eat Rocks’: Contesting the Thirty Meter Telescope in a Struggle over Science and Sovereignty in Hawai\`i.” 2020, n.d. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/70z6w502.

	This paper by Saraf Aanchal will be used to talk about the history of science in Hawaii and astronomy. This is an important aspect to the controversy that not a lot of people know about. I think it’s crucial that people understand this history because it gives more background as to why the Hawaiians are upset and it also goes into the difference between “traditional” and “western” science. I do reference one of the papers we read earlier in the term (Redrawing the Map by Fa-ti Fan) because there is a similar theme here with binaries in science. Aacnchal talks about how there is a history of science there that is being disregarded because of its roots in native culture. In order to fully understand the Hawaiians arguments, readers need to know about their prior knowledge of the stars and astronomy.

	This is the home page to the Maunakea & TMT site. There is a lot of great background information on this website.


Lopes, Kenedi, n.d.
	
	This will be an interview with my friend Kenedi, who is a Native Hawaiian. She grew up living at Kamehameha Schools, which is a Native Hawaiian school in Hawaii. She is deeply integrated into the Hawaiian culture. I want to get her view on the controversy as someone who is from Hawaii and also has a Native Hawaiian background.

Scanlan, Kawaiuluhonua, n.d.
	
	This will be an interview with my friend Kawai, who is a Native Hawaiian. She is a recent graduate where she majored in both psychology and Native American studies. Her focus is on Native Hawaiians and intends to go to law school. I want to get her view on the controversy as someone with her educational and personal background.
