Maunakea, an extinct volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii has been a hub for telescopes since the first one was built in 1979. It is currently the world’s largest astronomical observatories and over the past 40 years, a total of 13 telescopes have been built. Though the summit is loved by scientists due to its prime location, it is also considered sacred to the Native Hawaiians. In 2015, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) was approved to be built on top Maunakea, which sparked an uproar by Hawaiians around the globe. Previously, Natives had unsuccessfully stopped construction of telescopes upon their sacred mountain, but when they found out the scale of the newest project, they decided that enough was enough. 
TMT would be 18 stories tall with structures extending over 1.44 acres, which is much larger than any of the current telescopes built there. In terms of scientific research, TMT would allow astronomers to see 13 billion light-years away and scientists believe that it would give great insight into why we are on Earth and what else is out in the galaxy. Though the project would objectively be great for science, the question is, at what cost? Those who oppose TMT are unsettled both by the blatant disregard for the Native culture and brings to light the colonization that has taken place in Hawaii. 
I will talk about both the TMT supporter’s and opposer’s arguments in depth in the linked blog posts below, but first we should discuss the history of science and astronomy within the Hawaiian culture.
